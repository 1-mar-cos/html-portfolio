<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Juliana Marcos, and I am a web developer
with a strong passion for coding. Currently, I am 
honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to 
build functional and dynamic websites. I am eager
to deepen my knowledge of web development and 
expand my expertise in creating innovative digital 
solutions. Additionally, I am interested in web design,
particularly in crafting aesthetically pleasing websites 
that offer a seamless user experience.</p>

<p>In my current role at a police department in San Diego 
County, I manage administrative tasks, emergency phone 
calls, and radio communications with law enforcement 
officers. I am motivated by the prospect of merging 
my emergency management experience with my web 
development skills to create solutions that 
enhance emergency response times and support 
individuals in crisis situations. I am enthusiastic 
about the future of my web development journey and 
look forward to continuing to learn and grow in 
this field.</p>
